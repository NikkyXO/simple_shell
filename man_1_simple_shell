.SH NAME
hsh - a shell (standard command line interpreter)
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [-abcDefg] [argument ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh utility reads and interprets a command line string, either in interactive or non-interactive mode. It then executes commands based on the input. Both the local directory and PATH are searched.
When applicable, the function prints to stdout (standard output) or stderr (standard error) stream respectively.
In interactive mode, the shell will prompt with \' $ \', and process the input upon a return stroke. In non-interactive mode, standard output must be piped into the executable.

exit - Exit shell with a specified exit status
env - Print a list of the environment variables
setenv - Set a new environment variable

cd - Change directories
help - Prints help for built-ins

Ctrl-D - End of file: exit shell
